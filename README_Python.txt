# Python Codes

**Description:**  
This directory contains Python programs written for physics simulations, numerical methods, and general programming practice.  
All codes are currently saved in **`.txt` format** instead of `.py` for convenience and can be executed after renaming or copying the contents into a Python environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

Since most scripts are in `.txt` form, you can run them by:

### Option 1 ‚Äî Rename  
Rename the file to `.py` before running:
```bash
mv "Bubble sorting.txt" bubble_sort.py
python3 bubble_sort.py
